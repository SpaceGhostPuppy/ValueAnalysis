Date: December 4, 2024
========================================================

## CURRENT MEV LANDSCAPE

### MEV-Boost Infrastructure

1. Flashbots Dominance
Current Metrics:
- 85% of MEV-Boost relays
- Average block profit: 0.075 ETH
- Institutional validator share: 45%

Risk Factors:
- Centralization concerns
- Regulatory attention
- Censorship resistance

2. Alternative Relays
- Eden Network: Growing institutional adoption
